Oracle enhanced adapter for ActiveRecord

== DESCRIPTION:

Oracle "enhanced" ActiveRecord adapter contains useful additional methods for working with new and legacy Oracle databases
from Rails which are extracted from current real projects' monkey patches of original Oracle adapter.

See http://wiki.github.com/rsim/oracle-enhanced for usage information.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Latest version works (has been tested) with ActiveRecord version 2.3 and 3.0 (these are the same as Rails versions)
* Can be used on the following Ruby platforms:
  * MRI - requires ruby-oci8 2.0 gem to connect to Oracle (2.0.4 or later recommended)
  * Ruby/YARV 1.9.2 - requires ruby-oci8 2.0 library to connect to Oracle
  * JRuby 1.5 - uses JDBC driver ojdbc14.jar to connect to Oracle (should be in JRUBY_HOME/lib or in Java class path)
* Requires ruby-plsql gem to support custom create, update and delete methods (but can be used without ruby-plsql if this functionality is not needed)

== INSTALL:

* [sudo] gem install activerecord-oracle_enhanced-adapter

In addition install either ruby-oci8 (for MRI/YARV) or copy Oracle JDBC driver to $JRUBY_HOME/lib (for JRuby).
